# Python LISP Interpreter

This is the final project for Programming Language (CSE755) class back in 2010 Winter when I was studying in The Ohio State University.
I was a very beginner of Python at that time (well, I am still learning now).

The interpreter reads LISP input from a plain text file, interpreting one expression at a time.
An expression can be in multiple lines as long as it is correctly parenthesesed.
This interpreter is case-insensitive and only supports integer.
That is, any dot will be treated as a separator to the dot notation.
Empty parentheses will be treated as NIL.

For more detail, please take the CSE755 class and read the slides!!! LOL
